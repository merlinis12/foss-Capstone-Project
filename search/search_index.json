Therapeutics to prevent, delay and treat AD are urgently needed.  The management and treatment of AD risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent AD onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in AD. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying AD onset. </p>"},{"location":"Data_Management_Plan/#1-data-description","title":"1. Data Description","text":"<p>We use data from the UK Biobank to characterize the impact of therapeutics targeting AD risk factors has on AD and cognitive impairment. UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. The database is regularly augmented with additional data and is globally accessible to approved researchers. </p>"},{"location":"Data_Management_Plan/#2-data-collection","title":"2.

The original data remains at the UK Biobank and can be downloaded/obtained from them at any time when needed. Therefore, there are only costs for data access/right ('Maintenance Dataset'), and the datamanager ('Division') and data analysis tool/storage ('Other'). The data downloaded are stored in individual Box-health folder for each accepted researcher.

The folder is password-protected.</p> <p>The anonymisation of the data is irreversible in the hands of the researchers by way of the irreversible algorithm. UK Biobank retains an internal database which enables UK Biobank (and only UK Biobank) to reverse anonymise the data. They provide access to these data under their informed consent and only to people they deem certified to access these data. We obtain these data through a secure and encrypted link. The data are pseudonymised by the UK Biobank and are unique to each requested project; in other words the sampleIDs are random for each project number.
