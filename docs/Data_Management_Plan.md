# Data Management Plan

This document takes into consideration data that I use for my research.

### Project Title:
Identification of precision therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment

### Principal Investigator:
PhD Francesca Vitali

### Data Manager:
PhD Francesca Vitali

### Collaborators:
Simona Merlisi

### Project Rationale:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 5.8 million people in US with no effective therapeutic. Therapeutics to prevent, delay and treat AD are urgently needed.  The management and treatment of AD risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent AD onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in AD. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying AD onset. We aim to include in our analyses demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, disease stage, socioeconomic status) to stratify efficacy of each therapeutic for AD prevention in a given population.





## 1. Data Description
We will collect tree ring measurements from various tree species in our study area. Data will include tree ring width measurements, corresponding years, and species information. These measurements will be stored in structured CSV and RWL files, with metadata indicating sample location, collection date, and field methods.

We will use data from the UK Biobank (UKB,https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) as reference in many studies to characterize the impact of therapeutics targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors has on AD and cognitive impairment. This work will support the use of existing large-scale datasets and a precision medicine approach for characterization of sub-populations who will benefit from specific treatment. The results of these analyses will contribute to a growing body of evidence indicative of therapeutic including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogen modulating therapeutics amongst others within a responder subset and thus will have the potential to impact AD risk and course in clinical populations.![image](https://github.com/merlinis12/foss-Capstone-Project/assets/144267044/8e8738c7-68f7-4d45-8ec7-7ca26a0214d7)


## 2. Data Collection
Tree cores will be extracted from trees using increment borers. Ring width measurements will be taken using specialized equipment. Species identification will be done based on field observations and confirmed through lab analysis.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
Tree ring data and associated metadata will be stored in a dedicated directory on our secure research server. Automated daily backups will be conducted to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
Data will be organized by sample location, species, and collection year. Each dataset will have an accompanying metadata file detailing data structure, variable definitions, and data processing steps. 

(These metadata files are obtainable when downloading data through the [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring) tree ring archive.)

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
Upon project completion, the dataset will be deposited in a recognized tree ring database or repository, ensuring long-term preservation and discoverability ([NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring)). The repository will assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for reliable referencing.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
After a brief embargo period to allow for primary analysis, the dataset will be openly accessible through the repository under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, promoting data reuse with proper attribution.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
Ethics approval has been obtained for the study. All data collection follows ethical guidelines, and any potential impact on tree populations or ecosystems will be minimized.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
The lead dendrochronologist will oversee data management, ensuring accuracy and quality. Field technicians will collect core samples and measurements. The institution's data management team will facilitate repository submission.

## 9. Budget and Resources
Funding has been allocated for specialized dendrochronology equipment, data storage, repository fees, and data management software.

This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of tree ring data, in adherence to dendrochronological best practices and ethical standards. It promotes the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of tree ring research.
