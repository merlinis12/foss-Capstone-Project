# Data Management Plan

This document takes into consideration data that I use for my research.

### Project Title:
Identification of precision therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment

### Principal Investigator:
PhD Francesca Vitali

### Data Manager:
PhD Francesca Vitali

### Collaborators:
Simona Merlini

### Project Rationale:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 5.8 million people in US with no effective therapeutic. Therapeutics to prevent, delay and treat AD are urgently needed.  The management and treatment of AD risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, might delay or prevent AD onset. To this point, an untreated risk factor generates a cascade that with time increases in complexity and ultimately results in AD. Our aim is to select risk factor profiles that are targetable with a drug class and assess if a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics can disrupt the risk cascade modifying AD onset. We aim to include in our analyses demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, genotype, disease stage, socioeconomic status) to stratify efficacy of each therapeutic for AD prevention in a given population.





## 1. Data Description

We use data from the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) as reference in many studies to characterize the impact of therapeutics targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors has on AD and cognitive impairment. UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. The database is regularly augmented with additional data and is globally accessible to approved researchers undertaking vital research into the most common and life-threatening diseases. 


## 2. Data Collection

UK Biobank is a world-leading biomedical database to enable scientific discoveries that improve human health. Our goal is to inspire the imaginations of health researchers around the world to meet the challenge of greater understanding, prevention, and treatment of a range of serious illnesses. UK Biobank has Research Tissue Bank Approval till 2026 and through access to an unmatched amount of biological and medical data on half a million people living in the UK, we can enable your vision of improving human health. 
1. UK Biobank is a longitudinal study; it follows the health of 500,000 volunteer participants. 
2. Participants were aged between 40-69 years when they joined UK Biobank between 2006-2010. 
3. Each participant attended a baseline assessment at a centre in England (89%), Scotland (7%) and Wales (4%). 4. Participants provided their consent for long-term follow-up. 
5. Participants answered lots of questions about their health & lifestyle.
6. Participants donated samples of blood, urine and saliva for long-term storage and analysis. 
7. Physical measurements were also taken (e.g. height, weight, spirometry, blood pressure, heel bone density). 
8. Many participants have undertaken MR brain & heart imaging, activity monitoring and online follow-up questionnaires. 
9. We have genetic data on all 500,000 participants. 
10. UK Biobank is not representative of the general population with evidence of a ‘healthy volunteer’ selection bias, details of which are published online.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
Tree ring data and associated metadata will be stored in a dedicated directory on our secure research server. Automated daily backups will be conducted to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
Data will be organized by sample location, species, and collection year. Each dataset will have an accompanying metadata file detailing data structure, variable definitions, and data processing steps. 

(These metadata files are obtainable when downloading data through the [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring) tree ring archive.)

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
Upon project completion, the dataset will be deposited in a recognized tree ring database or repository, ensuring long-term preservation and discoverability ([NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring)). The repository will assign a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for reliable referencing.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
After a brief embargo period to allow for primary analysis, the dataset will be openly accessible through the repository under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license, promoting data reuse with proper attribution.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
Ethics approval has been obtained for the study. All data collection follows ethical guidelines, and any potential impact on tree populations or ecosystems will be minimized.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
The lead dendrochronologist will oversee data management, ensuring accuracy and quality. Field technicians will collect core samples and measurements. The institution's data management team will facilitate repository submission.

## 9. Budget and Resources
Funding has been allocated for specialized dendrochronology equipment, data storage, repository fees, and data management software.

This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of tree ring data, in adherence to dendrochronological best practices and ethical standards. It promotes the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of tree ring research.
