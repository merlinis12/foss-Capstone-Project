# FOSS Capstone Project

---
#####This is the repository for the Capstone project for CyVerse Foundational Open Science Skills 2023 Workshop. The repository contains some of the skills that I have learned over the 8 weeks of the course. In particular, I build and populated the repository with the Data Management Plan for my research. I also build a _resume git.io web page_ for the project and also for my personal website.
