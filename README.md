# FOSS Capstone Project

---
This is the repository for the Capstone project for CyVerse Foundational Open Science Skills 2023 Workshop.

The repository contains some of the skills that I have learned over the 8 weeks of the course. In particular, I build and populate the repository with the Data Management Plan I wrote for my research. I also build a resume git.io web page for the project and also for my personal website.
